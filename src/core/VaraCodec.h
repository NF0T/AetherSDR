// The VARA HF low-speed code: payload bits to DATA-frame symbols and back.
//
// THE MODEL. Recovered by measurement (docs/vara-cleanroom-design.md §3.27
// onward). The transmitted tone is
//
//     s[p] = ( d[p] + r[p] ) mod 16
//
// where `d` is a coded symbol that is GF(2)-linear in the payload across all
// four of its bit planes, and `r` is a fixed 407-value offset that does not
// depend on the payload — an ADDITIVE mod-16 scrambler. Adding rather than
// XORing is what made the top bits look nonlinear: the carry chain gives the
// four planes algebraic degrees 1, 1, 2 and 3, which is exactly what was
// measured before the model was found.
//
// Because `d` is linear, a baseline plus one generator row per payload bit
// determines everything:
//
//     d(payload) = d(0) XOR ( XOR of row_i for every set payload bit i )
//
// The payload block is 512 bits. `r` is only ever determinable modulo 8 —
// subtracting 8 flips just bit 3 and four terms cancel it — which is harmless,
// since the ambiguity is absorbed into the baseline and leaves the rows intact.
//
// PROVENANCE OF THE NUMBERS. The model file is data/vara/vara_model.json,
// produced by tools/vara_model_export.py from bench captures and committed so
// this does not depend on repeating nine hours of measurement. A real VARA
// modem decoded a frame synthesised from it for a payload it had never
// transmitted, which is the end-to-end proof that the model is right.
//
// SCOPE. Low-speed waveform only, and no ARQ: this converts payload to symbols
// and back. Control-frame generation and the link state machine are not here.

    // received word is not a codeword, so nothing satisfies every equation; the
